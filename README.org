* gitd
A way of notifying you when someone else pushes to a git repository

It will read /etc/gitd.conf to see which repositories to monitor, and keep copies of those in /etc/gitd/.
The daemon will fetch from the remote repositories and check if there is a change. If there is, it will send a Unix Domain Socket, where the client program can listen for the update.
