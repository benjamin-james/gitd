* gitd
A way of notifying you of git commits

It will read subdirectories (specified in the configuration file) to see which repositories to monitor.

You can symlink directories inside the gitd directory so it will fetch to those automatically.

The daemon will fetch from the remote repositories and check if there is a change.

If there is, it will send a notification to the user.

It is a forking daemon, so you don't need to do too much to set it up.

The configuration is in //etc/gitd/gitd.conf by default.

Type 'make' and 'sudo make install' to install it in //usr/local/bin/.
