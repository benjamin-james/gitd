* gitd
A way of notifying you of git commits

It will read subdirectories (specified in the configuration file) to see which repositories to monitor.

You can symlink directories inside the gitd directory so it will fetch to those automatically.

The daemon will fetch from the remote repositories and check if there is a change.

If there is, it will send a notification to the user.

It is a forking daemon, so you don't need to do too much to set it up.

The configuration should usually install to '/usr/local/etc/gitd.conf', so if you want to change that, specify --sysconfdir=/etc/gitd or whatever when you type ./configure

Type './autogen.sh', './configure', 'make' and 'sudo make install' to install it in '/usr/local/bin/' and the configuration file to '/usr/local/etc/'.

* systemd
Copy gitd.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/gitd.service
* Others
You can simply run gitd, but you can also start it at login by putting it in your ~/.bash_profile
