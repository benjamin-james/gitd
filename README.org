* gitd
A way of notifying you when someone else pushes to a git repository

It will read ~/.gitd/'s subdirectories to see which repositories to monitor.

You can symlink directories to inside ~/.gitd so it will fetch to those automatically.

The daemon will fetch from the remote repositories and check if there is a change. If there is, it will send a notification to the user.

It is a forking daemon, so you don't need to do too much to set it up.
